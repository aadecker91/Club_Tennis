  <h1>Gator Bowl Draws</h1>
  <div class="content">
  	<p>The draws for Gator Bowl can be found below. It may look confusing, but I tried to label where each match would go after a loss using #), S.#), and B.#). Unfortunately, the guys draw does not have a consolation because I don't think we would have the time to finish on Sunday, but the girls gold bracket  will have a consolation in order to ensure that each team plays at least 3 matches.</p>
  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
  	<p>The seedings for all A teams are based on the ToC standings, after that I just tried to make sure that no two teams from the same school would play each other first round.</p>
  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
  	<p>Another thing to note is that the times on the draws are rough estimates. When you finish your match, you will get your next scheduled match time. I made it so that there was a gap in matches near lunchtime so you can get food and come back. However, please let someone at the desk know if your team goes to eat.</p>
  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
  	<p>Please be at the courts at least 20-30 minutes prior to your scheduled match time. If your team is late, you will be penalized. 8am matches Saturday morning please come to Flavet (even if you play at SW) by 7:30 for check in and some extra info.</p>
